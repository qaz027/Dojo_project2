Kaggle has a heart disease dataset that incorporates patient information to predict prevalance of heart disease. It is 918 observations with 11 features and the heart disease target.

I will use this dataset to see if I can create a robust classification model to predict the presense of Heart Disease among patients.

Not a whole lot in the way of cleaning and modeling. Just working through the various models, tuning, and determining the best model for prediction

Incidents of Heart Disease in the dataset:
